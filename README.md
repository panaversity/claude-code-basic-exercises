## 🧠 The Problem-Solving Framework

Use this for EVERY exercise:

1. **Define** — What exactly am I trying to accomplish?
2. **Gather** — What files/data does Claude need?
3. **Specify** — Describe the desired outcome, constraints, and format
4. **Execute** — Run it with Claude Code or Cowork
5. **Verify** — Does the output match what I asked for?
6. **Iterate** — What would I change? Run it again.
7. **Reflect** — What did I learn about specifying problems clearly?
